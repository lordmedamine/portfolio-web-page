        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a fourth-year software engineering student at the
          Higher Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia of Gabès.
          Passionate about technology and innovation, I am dedicated to honing
          my skills through practical experience and continuous learning. Beyond
          my academic pursuits, I actively engage in programs at GoMyCode, where
          I delve into real-world projects and collaborate with industry
          professionals. This hands-on approach has enriched my understanding of
          software development, from coding intricate algorithms to designing
          user-friendly interfaces. As I advance in my studies, I am driven by a
          deep-seated curiosity to explore emerging technologies and contribute
          meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of software engineering.
